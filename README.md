## Business Decision Support

### Problem Statement

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers face challenges in optimizing their team compositions for consistent success. Many rely on intuition rather than data-driven insights, leading to suboptimal decisions regarding formations, player transfers, and budget allocation. Key challenges include:

**i) Lack of Data-Driven Decision Making** – Many managers do not leverage analytics to guide player selection.

**ii) Unclear Impact of Team Composition** – Determining the optimal balance of forwards, midfielders, and defenders over time is difficult.

**iii) Tracking Player Value Changes** – Player prices fluctuate throughout the season, affecting budget management.

**iv) Understanding Transfer Impact** – Weekly transfers need to be analysed for their impact on overall rank.

**v) Bench Utilization Issues** – Players on the bench often contribute significant points that go unused.

## Objective

This project aims to analyse team composition trends and player selection strategies by tracking how different formations, transfers, and budget decisions influence overall ranking. Insights from this analysis will help FPL managers make data-driven decisions to improve their rankings.

## Primary Data Sources

The project uses real-time data from the Fantasy Premier League API, which includes [See Python Script Here](https://github.com/Kolexx/Kolexx-FPL-Team-Composition-Performance-Analysis-Data-Extraction-Power-BI-Visualization/blob/main/scripts/FPL.ipynb):

- Player Information – Names, positions, teams, initial prices, and performance metrics.

- Gameweek Data – Weekly points, rankings, and overall team performance.

- Transfer Data – History of transfers made, including buying and selling prices.

- Team Selection Data – Players selected for each gameweek, including starters and bench players.
